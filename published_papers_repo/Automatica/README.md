## ðŸ“– Overview
This repository provides a Python implementation of a **one-shot data-driven LQR design** with robustness guarantees for stochastic linear systems. Unlike traditional model-based and iterative methods, our approach ensures **robust stability and suboptimality gap analysis** while avoiding data-hungriness. 

The key contributions of this work include:
- A **direct, non-iterative** learning approach for **discounted infinite-horizon LQR**.
- The **prior robustness-guaranteed** one-shot LQR learning method.
- A novel **data-driven Lyapunov inequality formulation** for stochastic closed-loop systems.
- A practical case study on **active car suspension control**.

## ðŸ“¦ Installation
Clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPO.git
cd YOUR-REPO
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ðŸš€ Usage
Run the main script to execute the LQR learning algorithm:

```bash
python automatica.py
```

## ðŸ“Š Results
Our method is validated on an **active car suspension simulation problem**, demonstrating superior robustness compared to existing methods.
